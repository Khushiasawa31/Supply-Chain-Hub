## SupplyChainHub

A system which automates building of smart contract for any type of product, at minimal cost.

Our project has two interfaces: Web App and Android App

The web platform is built in such a way that any user can build his own customized supply chain by deploying the auto generated smart contract.
A python script is used to generate this smart contract according to user needs.

It also features a p2p chat application, to connect all the members of the same supply chain. The chat app is built using ceramic, sockets and webrtc. Sockets and webrtc make the chat application realtime and ceramic is used to persist all messages.

The Android app uses the web3j library to interact with the smart contract through Java.
Individual products can be tracked by scanning barcodes through a user-friendly interface and the location can also be determined through Google Maps.

The project is built on Matic Network for faster, scalable transactions.

This brings 100% transparency on trading of goods by broadcasting the quantity with every entity in the supply chain and the transactions they have made for trading. Even the end user, i.e. the customer, can get all the information for that product by just scanning the product.

The apk to the mobile application can be found [here](/SupplyChainHub.apk)!
